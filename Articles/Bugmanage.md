### Guidance for tracking bugs, Exceptions and effective resolution 

Before signing off, ensure that the bug has been fixed and is no longer exploitable. Also, confirm that the fix hasn’t introduced any new issues or vulnerabilities. This can be verified through rigorous testing and validation. Conduct a post-mortem review to understand the root cause of the bug and how to prevent similar issues in the future. This ensures continuous improvement in the organization’s security practices.

1. Identify the Bug: Detect the security bug through automated security testing tools, manual code reviews, or user reports. Understand if it involves spoofing or tampering.
2. Understand the Bug: Comprehend the bug’s nature, its impact, and how it can be exploited. This step is crucial in understanding if there’s any information disclosure involved.
3. Develop a Fix: Create a solution for the bug. This could involve code modification, software dependencies update, or configuration changes. Consider if the bug could lead to a denial of service.
4. Test the Fix: Conduct thorough testing of the fix to ensure it resolves the bug without introducing new issues. Check if the bug could lead to an elevation of privilege.
5. Deploy the Fix: After testing, deploy the fix in a controlled manner in the production environment, with the ability to rollback if needed.
6. Verify the Fix: Post-deployment, confirm if the fix is working as expected in the production environment. Ensure there’s no chance of repudiation.
Document the Fix: Record the details of the bug, its impact, the fix, and any lessons learned. This documentation is useful for future reference and for improving the application’s security posture.

## Exception handling

1. Identify the Exception: Detect any deviations from the standard process or unexpected situations.
2. Initial Handling: Address the exception at the lower management level.
3. Escalation: If the exception cannot be resolved at the initial level, escalate it to higher management.
 - Low-Level Exceptions: Handled by low-level managers.
 - Mid-Level Exceptions: Escalated to mid-level managers.
 - High-Level Exceptions: Escalated to Vice Presidents or equivalent.
 - Time-Bound Resolution: Ensure each exception is time-bound, with a specific timeframe for resolution.
4. Resolution and Review: Resolve the exception within the stipulated time and conduct a review to prevent future occurrences.

## Possible workflow:

Start -> Identify Exception -> Initial Handling by Low-Level Manager -> Can it be resolved? -> Yes -> Resolve and Review -> End

 - If it cannot be resolved by the low-level manager -> Escalate to Mid-Level Manager -> Can it be resolved? -> Yes -> Resolve and Review -> End

 - If it cannot be resolved by the mid-level manager -> Escalate to High-Level Manager (VP or equivalent) -> Resolve and Review -> End
