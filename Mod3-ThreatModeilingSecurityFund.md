    <td>STRIKE: Helpful Artifacts for a Comprehensive Threat Modeling Review</td>
    <td>Helpful artifacts when it comes to preparing for threat modeling review. Help threat model reviewers to better understand the product by providing similar artifacts to abstract product information. When it comes to mitigations, security is an infinite game, and defense in depth is absolutely necessary. Trade off always happen, make it a clearly defined and educated one. When it comes threat modeling, do it early and do it often. Value clarity over process.</td>

    <td>STRIKE: Threat Modeling: A Proactive Approach to Security and Risk Management</td>
    <td>Ask questions, think bad, do good. Stop thinking of threat modeling as a compliance activity but as activity to improve the security design and product resilience. Continuous Assurance requires you owning your security and safety. Threat modeling is a collaborative process and not a solo exercise. We are in this together. Let's level up our engineering skills with threat modeling. Make products that are not only functional, but also secure and resilient from start. Let's avoid security incidents before they happen.</td>
