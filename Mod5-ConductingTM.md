        <td>In this exercise, a hypothetical threat scenario is presented, and the team is tasked with identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system. This process is not just about finding problems, but also about brainstorming and sharing ideas on how to improve the system’s resilience against such threats. It’s a time for open dialogue, where each participant can bring their unique perspective to the table, contributing to a more robust and comprehensive threat model. This iterative process of review and improvement helps in enhancing the overall security posture of the organization. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate all threats - an impossible task - rather to manage them in a way that minimizes risk and maximizes the organization’s ability to respond effectively when incidents occur.</td>
