# Threat Modeling Reviewer Program - built on the Microsoft peer review model
The purpose of the  Security training is to demystify the security review process in Continuous Secure Development Lifecycle (cSDL) and to develop and cultivate techniques and skills to help you be security minded in your solutions and serve as Threat Model Reviewers.

 

Goal:  High quality reviews of everything you build

Training Goal:  The goal of the Security Review training content is to provide you with a solid and well-rounded security and threat model foundation and the necessary tools and resources to conduct quality threat model reviews and security consultations.  This training allows us to share the responsibilities to actively /shift left and to continue to develop interested engineers across Microsoft . 

 

What does success look like? Completing the 6 modules, shadowing reviews, preparing for the tabletop exercise (final step before being Certified Reviewer), participating in the Microsoft Monthly Security Meetings, and serving as a peer reviewer.

 

 Security Program built out in 2023 provides  an engineering led security peer review program to help ensure we build solutions secure by design, and by default.

The  Security Program serves two primary functions: 1) security integration and engineer buy- in and 2) a scalable process that actively and continuously is /shifting left.  

 

This training was developed by Microsoft , to help engineers become reviewers and provide security peer review of what we build. 

If you are here and ready to start - the next steps are to:

Learn: Completing the 6 Modules will take you through the entire program and provide you a good understanding how to conduct a review.
Watch: Shadow a review or two.
Try: Complete a tabletop exercise and become a Reviewer.
